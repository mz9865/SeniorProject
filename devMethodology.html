    <h2>Planned Activities and Artifacts</h2>
    <p>We are planning to have standups every other meeting. On top of this, we plan to have end of sprint ceremonies
      every 2 weeks to show off what work we’ve done to our customer and plan out our next sprint. </p>

    <h2>Roles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Rui Ferreira: Coach</li>
      <li>Brandon Chu: Technical Lead</li>
      <li>Mason Zhong: Scrum Master</li>
      <li>Dylan Green: Sponsor Communication Lead</li>

    <h2>Tools</h2>
    <p>
      We will be using SmartSheets to keep track of our tasks and what’s the status of each. When testing, we will be
      using PyTest for our python code and Jest for our React code. For communication, we use Microsoft Teams and
      discord.

    <h2>Metrics and Measurements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Product: Defect Density (Defect per LOC) </li>
      <li>Product/Process: Volume of deliverables produced per unit effort (e.g. pages per hour, LOC per hour) </li>
      <li>Process: Estimation Accuracy (% difference between estimated hours and actual hours) </li>
      <li>Test: </li>
      <ul style="padding-left:20px">
        <li>Code Coverage </li>
        <li>% Of tests passed successfully </li>

  <div class="dev-method">
    <h2>Standards and Quality Practices</h2>
    <p>After work has been done for a task, the developer should keep their branch up to date and make sure no tests are
      failing. We’ll have a code review so someone other than the developer can have a look. After that, we’ll deploy
      the code after all tests are passed. Once deployed, the team will do further verification on the deployed
      environment and note any defects. </p>
