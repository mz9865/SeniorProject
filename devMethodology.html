    <p>We are planning to have standups every other meeting. On top of this, we plan to have end of sprint ceremonies
      every 2 weeks to show off what work we’ve done to our customer and plan out our next sprint. </p>

      We will be using SmartSheets to keep track of our tasks and what’s the status of each. When testing, we will be
      using PyTest for our python code and Jest for our React code.

    <h2>Standards and Quality Practices</h2>
    <p>After work has been done for a task, the developer should keep their branch up to date and make sure no tests are
      failing. We’ll have a code review so someone other than the developer can have a look. After that, we’ll deploy
      the code after all tests are passed. </p>
